<H3>You are testing the head pan/tilt</H3>
<H2>This does not test the laser tilt or hokuyo</H2>
<body>
Follow these instructions carefully. If your laser tilt MCB is plugged in, this test will not work.
<itemize>
<item>Plug your etherCAT cable directly in to the head pan MCB. This is located inside the "doghouse" on the write. The laser tilt MCB may be plugged in that port, unplug that if necessary.</item>

<item>Make sure your power cable is connected to the head pan MCB.</item>

<item>This test will run a hysteresis test and sinesweep on both the pan and tilt joints. It will not work if the laser tilt MCB is plugged in.</item>

<item>To test the laser tilt, press "Cancel", and scan the barcode on the side of the laser tilt.</item>

<item>If the computer detects 3 MCB's instead of 2, you may have left the laser tilt MCB plugged in.</item>

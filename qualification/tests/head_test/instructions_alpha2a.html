<H1>Alpha 2.0a Head only</H1>
<H2>You are testing the Alpha 2.0a head (small tilt motor)</H2>
<H3>This does not test the laser tilt or hokuyo</H3>
<body>
Follow these instructions carefully. If your laser tilt MCB is plugged in, this test will not work.
<br>
<br>The Alpha 2.0a head has the same size tilt motor as the Alpha 1.0 head, but a different gear ratio. To check if this is an Alpha 2.0a head, make sure it can tip forward approximately 80 degrees. If yes, it is Alpha 2.0a or 2.0b. If it has the <b>small</b> motor, it is Alpha 2.0a. If you see a larger tilt motor, you are using the wrong test.
<br>
<br><b>Do not proceed if you are not sure.</b>
<br>
<br>Plug your etherCAT cable directly in to the head pan MCB. This is located inside the "doghouse" on the back right. The laser tilt MCB may be plugged in that port, unplug that if necessary.
<br>
<br>Make sure your power cable is connected to the head pan MCB.
<br>
<br>This test will run a hysteresis test and sinesweep on both the pan and tilt joints. It will not work if the laser tilt MCB is plugged in.
<br>
<br>To test the laser tilt, press "Cancel", and scan the barcode on the side of the laser tilt.
<br>
<br>If the computer detects 3 MCB's instead of 2, you may have left the laser tilt MCB plugged in.

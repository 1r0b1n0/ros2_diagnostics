  <description brief="Tools relating to self-tests.">
    A self_test is a service call provided by a node that triggers a
    test of the driver and any associated hardware. This service call can
    be used by users to quickly verify that a device or process is working.
    Currently self-tests are mainly used with drivers, but nothing
    precludes non-driver nodes using them.
    <br>
    The self_test package contains tools to for calling the self-test
    service from the command-line, or from a regression test. It also
    provides a C++ API for facilitating writing of self-tests.

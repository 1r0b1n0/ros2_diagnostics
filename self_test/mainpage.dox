\b self_test contains the \ref Sequencer class that can be used to sequence
a set of tests to be run in order to test a device. It advertizes a
self_test service. When the service is called, the \ref Sequencer calls the 
tests that have been defined in order, and combines the results into a
\ref diagnostic_msgs::DiagnosticsArray. A detailed example can be found in 
\ref selftest_example.cpp.
